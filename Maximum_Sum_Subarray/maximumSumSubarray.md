# MAXIMUM SUM SUBARRAY

Given an one dimensional array of size N having both positive and negative integers. Find the sum of subarray such that it has the largest sum among all subarrays.

Input format:
First line: A single integer denoting the value of N.
Next line: N single-separated integers denoting the elements of array

Output format:
Single integer denoting the value of required maximum sum of subarray.

Sample input:
8

2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3

Sample output:
7

Sample explanation:
The subarray → 4 -1 -2 1 5 gives sum 7 which is the largest sum among all subarrays. Hence the answer is 7.
